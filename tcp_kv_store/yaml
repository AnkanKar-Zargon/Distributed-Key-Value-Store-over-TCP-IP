## ⚙️ Build Instructions

Make sure you’re on a **Linux/Unix system** with `g++` installed.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tcp_kv_store.git
cd tcp_kv_store

# Build project
make


# This will create two executables:

# server → Starts the TCP/IP server
# client → Starts a client that connects to the server
```
