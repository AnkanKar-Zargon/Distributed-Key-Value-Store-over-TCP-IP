# Distributed-Key-Value-Store-over-TCP-IP
Weâ€™ll build a TCP/IP server in C++ that:  Accepts multiple client connections.  Stores key-value pairs in memory.  Allows clients to SET key value and GET key.  Runs on Linux using sockets and fork() to handle multiple clients.  This mimics a tiny distributed cache (like Redis).
